# 3D Visual AI Getting Started Series Summary
This two-part series introduces the foundational tools for working with 3D data in FiftyOne — from loading and visualizing raw point clouds to integrating annotations and exploring scenes in 3D.

## Summary of Steps
### Step 1: Getting Started with 3D Datasets
In this step, you'll learn how to load raw 3D datasets — such as LiDAR point clouds — into FiftyOne. You’ll explore FiftyOne’s interactive 3D viewer, learn basic navigation, and understand how to structure your dataset for spatial data tasks.

### Step 2: Getting Started with Loading 3D Annotations
Now that you’ve got 3D data loaded, it’s time to enrich it with annotations. You’ll learn how to import and overlay 3D labels such as bounding boxes, enabling powerful workflows for inspection, validation, and debugging.

This series is part of the Getting Started with FiftyOne initiative. For more tutorials, head to the [FiftyOne Documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com/).

## Next Steps
Here are some ways to keep exploring 3D in FiftyOne:

-   **Evaluate 3D Object Detection Models**
    Bring in predictions and ground truth to run performance evaluations on 3D bounding boxes.

-   **Visualize Multi-modal Sensor Data**
    Combine point clouds with 2D images, segmentation masks, and more for a full-scene understanding.

-   **Connect with the Community**  
    Share your findings, ask questions, or browse community projects on the
    [FiftyOne Discord](https://community.voxel51.com) or
    [GitHub Discussions](https://tbd.com).

-   **Read the Docs**
