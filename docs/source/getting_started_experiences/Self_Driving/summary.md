# Self-Driving Getting Started Series Summary
This two-part series walks you through the essentials of working with self-driving car datasets in FiftyOne — from initial loading to advanced curation and filtering workflows.

## Summary of Steps
### Step 1: Loading a Self Driving Car Dataset into FiftyOne
Learn how to load complex self-driving datasets into FiftyOne. You’ll work with multi-frame video samples, synchronize labels with timestamps, and explore how to navigate temporal sequences inside the app.

### Step 2: Advanced Self Driving Dataset Techniques
Take things further by exploring advanced tools for managing and curating your self-driving data. This includes filtering key events, working across sequences, and identifying frames for annotation, validation, or model training.

This series is part of the Getting Started with FiftyOne initiative. For more tutorials, visit the [FiftyOne Documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com/).

## Next Steps
Now that you've completed the Self-Driving Getting Started series, here are some ideas for what to do next:

-   **Visualize Point Clouds**
    Extend your dataset by adding and visualizing LiDAR point clouds using FiftyOne’s 3D visualization tools.

-   **Evaluate Models on Sequences**
    Bring in predictions from your self-driving models and evaluate them frame-by-frame or sequence-wide using FiftyOne’s evaluation APIs.

-   **Connect with the Community**  
    Share your findings, ask questions, or browse community projects on the
    [FiftyOne Discord](https://community.voxel51.com) or
    [GitHub Discussions](https://tbd.com).

-   **Read the Docs**
