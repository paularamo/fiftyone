# Medical Imaging Getting Started Series Summary

This quick tutorial walks you through the core components of working with medical imaging data in FiftyOne — especially DICOM and CT scan files.

## Summary of Steps

### Step 1: Getting Started with Medical Imaging

In this first step, we look at how to work with medical imaging samples in FiftyOne, focusing on DICOM files and CT scan data formats. We won’t cover typical .jpg or .png image files here — for that, refer to the standard [FiftyOne quickstart](https://docs.voxel51.com/quickstart.html).


## Next Steps

Now that you've completed the Detection Getting Started series, here are
some suggested next steps to deepen your journey with FiftyOne:

-   **Explore Model Evaluation**  
    Learn how to evaluate segmentation models by comparing predictions against
    ground truth, and identifying failure cases in your dataset.

-   **Try Out FiftyOne Plugins**  
    Extend your workflow with powerful plugins like video embeddings, active
    learning tools, and integrations with annotation platforms.

-   **Connect with the Community**  
    Share your findings, ask questions, or browse community projects on the
    [FiftyOne Discord](https://community.voxel51.com) or
    [GitHub Discussions](https://tbd.com).

-   **Load Your Own Dataset**  
    Adapt these workflows to your real-world medical projects. Whether
    it's DICOM or CT scans — FiftyOne supports it all.

-   **Read the Docs**  
    Dive deeper into what FiftyOne can do in the
    [official documentation](https://docs.voxel51.com/).

We can't wait to see what you'll build next with FiftyOne!
