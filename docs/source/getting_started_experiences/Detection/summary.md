# Detection Getting Started Series Summary

This short series walks you through the core components of working with
detection data in FiftyOne — from loading and visualizing, to evaluating and finding mistakes

## Summary of Steps

### Step 1: Loading a Detection Dataset in FiftyOne

Explore how to load detection datasets into FiftyOne using both built-in
datasets from the zoo and custom datasets

### Step 2: Adding Object Detections

Learn how to add object detections predictions to your datasets using both
pre-trained from model zoo and your own models.

### Step 3: Find Detection Mistakes in FiftyOne

Dive into the advanced capabilities of FiftyOne by using the [FiftyOne Brain](https://docs.voxel51.com/brain.html) to find detection mistakes. Erroneous boxes, class mistakes, or overlapping boxes can all be found using FiftyOne!

### Step4: Evaluating Detections

Learn how to use FiftyOne to perform hands-on evaluation of your detection model. This includes evaluating your model using FiftyOne’s evaluation API and viewing the best and worst performing samples in your dataset
